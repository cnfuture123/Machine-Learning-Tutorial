# Rules of Machine Learning
https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/

## Terminology
- Metric: A number that you care about. May or may not be directly optimized.
- Pipeline: The infrastructure surrounding a machine learning algorithm. Includes gathering the data from the front end, putting it into training data files, training one or more models, and exporting the models to production.
- Click-through Rate: The percentage of visitors to a web page who click a link in an ad.

## Overview
- Make sure your pipeline is solid end to end.
- Start with a reasonable objective.
- Add common sense features in a simple way.
- Make sure that your pipeline stays solid.

## Rules of ML
- Rule #1: Donâ€™t be afraid to launch a product without machine learning. If machine learning is not absolutely required for your product, don't use it until you have data.
- Rule #2: First, design and implement metrics. Before formalizing what your machine learning system will do, add a metric to track as much as possible in your current system.
- Rule #3: Choose machine learning over a complex heuristic. A complex heuristic is unmaintainable and you will find that the machine learned model is easier to update and maintain.
- Rule #4: Keep the first model simple and get the infrastructure right. Your simple model provides you with baseline metrics and a baseline behavior that you can use to test more complex models.
- Rule #5: Test the infrastructure independently from the machine learning. 
- Rule #6: Be careful about dropped data when copying pipelines. Often we create a pipeline by copying an existing pipeline (i.e., cargo cult programming ), and the old pipeline drops data that we need for the new pipeline.
- Rule #7: Turn heuristics into features, or handle them externally. Usually the problems that machine learning is trying to solve are not completely new. There are a bunch of rules and heuristics which give you a lift when tweaked with machine learning. There are four ways you can use an existing heuristic: 1.Preprocess using the heuristic. 2.Create a feature. 3.Mine the raw inputs of the heuristic. 4.Modify the label.
